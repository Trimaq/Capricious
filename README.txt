Caprious 1.0

Hello! This is my personal repository where anyone can add whatever they want, the goal is to create an all purpose software and can do a bunch of random useful tasks.

What I (Personally) want in the software - 

1. Calculator
2. A Fast math calculator like https://www.mathway.com/Algebra
3. Discord bot to go with it.
4. WHATEVER YOU WANT! 


So as you can tell its got alot of math and school related things, but as a teen thats the first thing that came to mind! so you guys add whatever you want within reason.
